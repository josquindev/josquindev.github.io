                <p>Gaming with friends is something I enjoy a lot. We are a group of 4-5 players who like
                    various type of games, from miniatures to boardgames and card games, but also medieval or
                    futuristic RPG like <em>"Shadowrun"</em>.

                <p>
                    My favourite game settled in a dystopic future is the card game <em>Android : Netrunner</em>.
                    It is a very subtle mix between Poker, Chess and fair amount of ressources management.

                <p>Still one of my favourite hobby when I am given time, which has become sparse over time.
                    It's always a pleasure to discover new productions, like the really good <em>Baldur's Gate III</em>
                    (made in Belgium, cocoricooo !! ^^ )
