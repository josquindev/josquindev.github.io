                    <p>My name is Josquin Decourcelle. I was born in 1981
                        in Tournai, where I currently live with my wife, our
                        9 years old son, and two cats... (actually, we live in <em>their</em> house :)</p>

                    <p>My little fellow discovered quite early computers and all kind of
                        geeky stuff, which he absolutely loves ! It won't take long for Dad to
                        be outclassed !
                    </p>

                    <p>Similarly, I was early exposed to computers in the late 80's, starting
                        with MS-DOS on a 286 SX 10 Mhz (!). Ever since, the passion kept on growing,
                        exploring many fields like 3D CG in the mid 90's, electronic music
                        with Reason, Traktor and Ableton, and more recently development with
                        SQL Server, C# and VBA.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle that with a good dose of video games,
                    and you get a pretty good picture of my free-time behind the screen !

                    <p>Strangely enough, I didn't follow the IT path rightaway and, 17 years ago, I started
                        by pure chance a career in the concrete industry as a Quality Manager.
                        Altough it has never been my cup of tea, I took this job seriously and put into
                        practice my IT knowledge to drastically automatize Quality monitoring,
                        among many other things. (like this map in Sketchup :)

            I closed this chapter of my life... Time has come to write a new one. </p>
